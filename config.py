First Comment:
Hey Product Hunt! ðŸ‘‹
I created Mac Development Setup because I was tired of wasting an entire day configuring a new Mac when I could be doing actual work. This toolkit automates everything I need for a productive development environment - from Homebrew packages to shell configuration, Node.js, Python, Git setup, and more.
What makes this different:
Modular design: Install only what you need
Security-focused: Clear separation between public and private data
Comprehensive: Handles everything from dev tools to macOS preferences
I'd love to hear what you think and what other features would be useful! What's your biggest pain point when setting up a new development machine?
